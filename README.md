**Details**: Use this extension to send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.

Adding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('emails').add({
  to: [
    {
      email: 'recipient@example.com',
      name: 'Recipient name'
    }
  ],
  from: {
    email: 'from@example.com',
    name: 'From name'
  },
  cc: [
    {
      email: 'cc.recipient@example.com',
      name: 'CC recipient name'
    }
  ],
  bcc: [
    {
      email: 'bcc.recipient@example.com',
      name: 'Bcc recipient name'
    }
  ],
  subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',
  html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',
  text: 'This is an TEXT email body.',
  template_id: 'abc123ced',
    variables: [
      {
        email: 'recipient@example.com',
        substitutions: [
          {
            var: 'variable_name',
            value: 'variable value'
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    personalization: [
      {
        email: 'recipient@example.com',
        data: {
          personalization_name: 'personalization value'
        }
      }
    ],
    tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
    reply_to: {
      email: 'reply_to@example.com',
        name: 'Reply to name'
    },
    send_at: '123465789'
})
```
# Using the extension

After its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `EMAIL_COLLECTION` collection. Email is sent based on the contents of the document's fields. The document's fields specify an email data.

#### Collection fields

When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)
